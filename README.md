# MidiCleaner

## TODO

* Refactor CLI... it went off the Rails when I went to multiple files
* Correctly handle input dir with only one file (I think it fails)
* Update typespecs (?) in @callback definitions
* Review expected vs actual convention in ExUnit
* Handle multiple files in parallel
* Report results
* Report progress
* Handle failures
